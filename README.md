# ExtraVM DDoS-Protected VPS: Premium NVMe Performance, Global Locations, Lifetime Discounts

So you're hunting for a VPS host that doesn't mess around. Something fast, reliable, and not run by people who think customer support means an automated chatbot that apologizes for being useless. Well, let me tell you about ExtraVM—a hosting provider that's been doing this since 2014 and somehow manages to make server hosting feel less like a transaction and more like, well, something that actually works.

Founded in Dallas, Texas, ExtraVM started with a simple idea that somehow eludes most of the hosting industry: give people fast servers with actual DDoS protection at prices that don't require a small loan. Fast forward to 2026, and they're running operations across eight global locations with hardware that makes other budget hosts look like they're still using equipment from the early 2000s.

## What Makes ExtraVM Different From the Crowd

Here's the thing about the VPS hosting space—it's crowded, it's noisy, and most providers sound exactly the same. Everyone promises "blazing fast speeds" and "99.9% uptime" until your site goes down at 3 AM and you realize their support team is actually just a FAQ page with a chatbot strapped to it.

ExtraVM takes a different approach. They're the kind of company where the founder, Mike, actually responds to support tickets. Not occasionally. Regularly. Multiple Trustpilot reviews from 2024 and 2025 specifically mention him by name, which tells you something about how hands-on this operation is. When was the last time you knew the name of anyone at your hosting company?

Their infrastructure runs on AMD Ryzen 9 and EPYC processors paired with NVMe SSD storage in RAID configurations. Translation? Your websites load fast, your applications run smooth, and you're not sitting around waiting for disk I/O to catch up with your ambitions. They've deployed servers in Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Secaucus (that's the New York metro area for the geographically challenged), Montreal, Amsterdam, Singapore, and Sydney. If you need to serve content somewhere on Earth, they probably have a datacenter that makes sense for you.

The DDoS protection isn't just marketing speak either. They run a multi-layered system that includes upstream filtering, local network mitigation, proprietary XDP filters, and hardware-level firewalls. When someone tries to knock your server offline, ExtraVM has four separate lines of defense before your site even notices something's wrong.

## VPS Plans That Make Sense

Let's talk money. ExtraVM's VPS plans start at $4.50 per month for 1GB RAM, which gets you a single Ryzen core, 15GB of NVMe storage, 5TB bandwidth, and complete DDoS protection. That's not a promotional price that vanishes after month one—that's the actual price.

If you're doing something more serious, their popular plans cluster around the $8-35 monthly range. Here's what you can expect across their major locations:

| **Plan** | **RAM** | **CPU Cores** | **NVMe Storage** | **Bandwidth** | **Network Speed** | **Monthly Price** |
|----------|---------|---------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Entry | 1GB | 1 Core | 15GB | 5TB | 1Gbps | $4.50 |
| Basic | 2GB | 1 Core | 30GB | 5TB | 1-2.5Gbps | $8.00 |
| Standard | 3GB | 2 Cores | 45GB | 5TB | 1-2.5Gbps | $12.00 |
| Plus | 4GB | 2 Cores | 60GB | 10TB | 1-5Gbps | $14.00 |
| Professional | 5GB | 3 Cores | 75GB | 10TB | 1-5Gbps | $17.50 |
| Premium | 6GB | 4 Cores | 90GB | 20TB | 1-5Gbps | $21.00 |
| Advanced | 8GB | 4 Cores | 120GB | 20TB | 1-5Gbps | $28.00 |
| Business | 10GB | 6 Cores | 150GB | 20TB | 1-5Gbps | $35.00 |

The specs vary slightly by location—Los Angeles and Miami get up to 10Gbps connections on the higher-tier plans, while Singapore and Australia have slightly adjusted bandwidth allocations. But the core value proposition stays consistent: modern hardware, real DDoS protection, and pricing that doesn't make you question your life choices.

If you're migrating from another host and worried about cost, ExtraVM has your back. They offer price matching. Send them your current invoice, and if it's for comparable service, they'll see what they can do. Not many hosts bother with that level of flexibility.

Before diving into your first order, it's worth checking if there's a promotional opportunity that could save you some cash. ExtraVM currently runs several active discount codes for new customers looking to test their infrastructure.

## Current Promotional Codes for January 2026

Speaking of saving money—and who doesn't enjoy keeping a few extra dollars in their pocket—ExtraVM has several promotional codes active right now:

**25SWITCH** gets you 25% off your first month on any VPS plan. This code works across all their locations and applies to both monthly and quarterly billing terms. If you're switching from another provider (hence the code name), this takes a decent chunk off your first invoice.

For game server hosting, the code **GAME30** delivers 30% off your first month. This applies to their Minecraft, Valheim, ARK, and other game server plans, which run through their Pterodactyl control panel for easy management.

There's also a lifetime discount option floating around various hosting review sites: **THR12** reportedly gives 10% off for the life of your account on certain plans. The catch is this code appears to be exclusive to visitors from ThisHosting.Rocks, one of the review sites that's covered ExtraVM extensively.

For those eyeing their 2GB+ VPS plans, keep an eye out for occasional **50% off first month** promotions, though these tend to have limited stock and sell out during high-demand periods.

The discount landscape changes, but here's what you need to know: ExtraVM runs promotions without playing games. The prices you see after the promotional period are the actual prices. No sudden jumps from $5/month to $45/month when the "special introductory rate" expires. That kind of transparency is rarer than you'd think in the hosting world.

If you're serious about getting started with a solid VPS host that won't disappear on you or suddenly triple your renewal price, now's a good time to 👉 [explore ExtraVM's current VPS plans and lock in your server](https://extravm.com/billing/aff.php?aff=703). Their infrastructure across eight global locations means you can deploy where it makes sense for your users, not where it's convenient for the hosting company.

The beauty of their setup is the instant activation. Most VPS orders go live immediately after payment clears, which means you're not sitting around for 24-48 hours while someone manually provisions your server. You order, you get your login credentials, and you're off to the races.

## Web Hosting for People Who Actually Use Websites

Not everyone needs a VPS. Sometimes you just want to host a WordPress site, maybe a small business page, or a portfolio without dealing with server administration. ExtraVM's web hosting plans run on SPanel control panels with LiteSpeed web servers, backed by the same NVMe storage that powers their VPS infrastructure.

Their web hosting comes in three tiers:

**Web Basic** starts at $3.99/month (or $3.33/month annually) and includes 10GB NVMe storage, unlimited domains, and unmetered bandwidth. The plan supports two CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and has process limits generous enough for most small sites. LiteSpeed handles the actual serving, which means your sites load noticeably faster than they would on hosts still running Apache without optimization.

**Web Premier** jumps to $6.99/month (or $5.83/month annually) with 25GB storage and the same unlimited domain setup. If you're running multiple sites or one moderately busy WordPress installation, this tier gives you breathing room without the resource anxiety that plagues cheaper shared hosting.

**Web Ultimate** tops out at $9.99/month (or $8.33/month annually) with 50GB storage and increased process limits of 250 instead of 200. This is the plan for people running small business sites with actual traffic or multiple WordPress installations that would choke on typical shared hosting.

All three plans include automatic Let's Encrypt SSL certificates, unlimited FTP and email accounts, MySQL and PostgreSQL database access, and support for NodeJS, Python, and Ruby on Rails. They also throw in Softaculous for one-click installations of WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and a couple dozen other common web applications. 

The web hosting runs in two locations: Dallas, Texas and Falkenstein, Germany. If you're primarily serving North American traffic, Dallas makes sense. European visitors? Falkenstein will give you better latency. The choice is yours.

One detail worth mentioning: they handle migrations. If you're currently with another web host and don't want to deal with the tedious process of moving everything over, ExtraVM's support team will do it for you. Just open a ticket after signing up. This isn't an upsold service—it's included.

## Game Server Hosting That Doesn't Lag When It Matters

Gaming servers are where many people first discover ExtraVM, particularly Minecraft hosts looking for something better than the commodity providers with their oversold resources and "contact us when your server crashes" support philosophy.

ExtraVM's game server hosting starts at $3.00 per month for smaller Minecraft servers, scaling up based on RAM allocation and game requirements. Here's the typical Minecraft server pricing:

| **RAM** | **Storage** | **Monthly Price** | **Best For** |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1GB | Unlimited | $3.20 | Small vanilla servers, 3-5 players |
| 2GB | Unlimited | $6.00 | Modded servers, 5-10 players |
| 3GB | Unlimited | $9.00 | Medium communities, 10-15 players |
| 4GB | Unlimited | $12.00 | Larger modpacks, 15-20 players |
| 5GB | Unlimited | $15.00 | Heavy modpacks, 20-25 players |
| 8GB | Unlimited | $24.00 | Large communities, complex mods |

The servers run on Ryzen 9 processors with NVMe storage and come with the Pterodactyl control panel, which handles file management, backups, and server controls through a clean web interface. DDoS protection is included, which matters more for gaming servers than people realize. Public Minecraft servers attract script kiddies who think it's hilarious to knock communities offline.

ExtraVM supports essentially every popular game server: Minecraft (Java and Bedrock), Valheim, ARK Survival Evolved/Ascended, V-Rising, Satisfactory, Squad, CS:GO, Rust, and more. The pricing varies by game—ARK servers start around $18-24 monthly because they're resource-intensive monsters that require more horsepower than a typical Minecraft server.

One review from a gaming community mentioned that ExtraVM helped them set up a modpack that wasn't on the standard installation list. Support had it running within five minutes. That's the kind of service that keeps communities from rage-quitting to another provider after the first problem.

For anyone running game servers seriously—meaning you've got a community that depends on uptime and performance—the 👉 [game server hosting from ExtraVM](https://extravm.com/billing/aff.php?aff=703) delivers the kind of consistency that keeps players happy. The hardware is modern, the networks are solid, and when something does go wrong (because hardware fails eventually), support actually responds.

Their game server locations span Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Montreal, Amsterdam, Sydney, Singapore, and Tokyo. If you're building a community in Southeast Asia, that Singapore location with its DDoS protection and low latency to surrounding countries makes a real difference. Same for Australian communities using the Sydney servers—finally getting under 50ms ping instead of routing through US datacenters.

## What Real Users Actually Say

Let's cut through the marketing and look at what people who've actually used ExtraVM have to say. Their Trustpilot rating sits at a perfect 5 stars based on 53 reviews, which would normally make me suspicious except the reviews read like they're written by actual humans who've used hosting services before.

A September 2025 review mentions someone who used ExtraVM back in 2020, left, and came back because "the quality has improved since then if anything." They specifically call out the technical support responding "remarkably quickly to issues of any severity." That's not generic "great service!" praise—that's someone comparing their experience across providers.

Another review from November 2024 notes the combination of "top tier performance with top tier reliability," which might sound like marketing copy except it's coming from a customer talking about consistent uptime over multiple years of service.

One particularly detailed review from April 2021 (still relevant because infrastructure doesn't change overnight) breaks down their experience switching from other hosts: "I love the fact that ExtraVM makes my pages faster at no additional effort with the shared hosting." They mention being recommended a cheaper shared Minecraft plan instead of the VPS they initially tried to buy—support literally talked them into spending less money because it fit their needs better.

Not everything is perfect. One user mentioned trying to order a Singapore server only to have the order refunded due to unavailability. Fair criticism, though ExtraVM refunded immediately rather than stringing them along. Popular locations sometimes sell out, especially during promotional periods.

The common threads across reviews: fast hardware, network stability that actually holds up, and support that acts like they care whether your server works. Mike (the founder) gets mentioned by name in multiple reviews for personally handling support tickets, which is either impressive dedication or slightly concerning work-life balance. Probably both.

## The Technical Details That Matter

Let's talk hardware specifics for people who care about what's actually running their services.

ExtraVM's Dallas location runs AMD Ryzen 9 and EPYC processors with 128-256GB DDR4/DDR5 RAM and enterprise NVMe drives in RAID configurations. Network connectivity through AS63018 provides solid routing throughout North America with speeds up to 1Gbps on entry plans, scaling to 2.5-5Gbps on higher tiers.

The Miami deployment uses Ryzen 9 CPUs with 128-256GB DDR5 RAM, NVMe storage, and network speeds up to 10Gbps on larger plans. This location runs on the ReliableSite network, which handles high-capacity DDoS mitigation and provides excellent latency to Latin America.

Los Angeles operates from Digital Realty's Burbank facility on the latest AMD Zen5 Ryzen 9950X or EPYC 4005 processors with 192-256GB DDR5 RAM. Network speeds reach 10Gbps on higher-tier plans, and the location provides optimal connectivity between North America and Asia.

The Secaucus, New Jersey location (serving the New York metro area) mirrors the Los Angeles setup with Ryzen 9/EPYC processors, 192-256GB DDR5 RAM, NVMe storage, and 10Gbps network capabilities. The proximity to Manhattan provides excellent routing to the US Northeast and Western Europe.

Amsterdam runs from Digital Realty with Ryzen 9 CPUs, 192-256GB DDR5 RAM, and 10Gbps network connectivity. Europe-based projects get excellent routing throughout the continent from this location.

Singapore uses Datapacket's facility with Ryzen 9/EPYC or Intel E-series processors, 128-192GB RAM, and 10Gbps network speeds. The location provides optimal latency throughout Southeast Asia.

Sydney deploys from Equinix with AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processors, 192-256GB DDR5 RAM, NVMe storage, and 10Gbps connectivity. Australian and New Zealand projects get proper local hosting instead of routing through US or Asian datacenters.

Tokyo operates from Equinix TY8 with similar specifications to Sydney, providing excellent connectivity throughout East Asia and back to North America.

All locations include IPv4 and IPv6 (/64 subnet), the ability to use custom ISOs via HTTPS download links, nested virtualization support, and SSH access for VPS plans. DDoS protection capacity varies by location but includes multi-layered mitigation at every deployment.

For those who need absolute reliability, ExtraVM uses server-grade hardware across the board: server motherboards, enterprise NVMe and SSD drives, and mirrored drive configurations. That said, they're upfront about one thing: if your data is truly critical, maintain your own backups. Hardware failures happen eventually, no matter how good the equipment.

## Why ExtraVM Makes Sense in 2026

The hosting market is honestly a mess. You've got oversold shared hosting that collapses under actual traffic. You've got cloud providers that charge by the millisecond and leave you deciphering bills that require a finance degree. You've got budget VPS hosts running ancient hardware and hoping you don't notice.

ExtraVM sits in a sweet spot: modern hardware, transparent pricing, actual DDoS protection, and support run by people who seem to understand that uptime matters. They're not trying to be everything to everyone. They do VPS hosting, web hosting, and game servers. That's it. No domain registration, no website builders, no email marketing platforms bolted onto the side of the business.

The pricing stays consistent after promotional periods end. The hardware gets upgraded regularly—they mention constantly moving clients to better equipment. The support team actually responds, often within minutes for urgent issues.

If you're shopping for hosting in 2026, you're probably tired of the same sales pitches promising "unlimited everything" while delivering resources that cap out the moment you do anything interesting. ExtraVM doesn't play that game. You get specific allocations, modern hardware, and if something goes wrong, someone who knows what they're doing will help you fix it.

Whether you need a single VPS for a project, web hosting for a business site, or game servers for a community, ExtraVM has infrastructure that makes sense. Eight global locations mean you can deploy where your users actually are. Modern AMD processors and NVMe storage mean your applications run fast. Multi-layered DDoS protection means your services stay online when someone decides to be a nuisance.

The promotional codes floating around—particularly that 25% first month discount and the various lifetime discount options—make it easier to test their service without committing serious money upfront. And that five-day money-back guarantee means you can actually try the service and bail if it doesn't work for your needs.

For anyone tired of hosts that oversell and underdeliver, now might be the right time to 👉 [check out what ExtraVM offers](https://extravm.com/billing/aff.php?aff=703) across their global infrastructure. The combination of modern hardware, transparent pricing, and actual human support creates something increasingly rare: hosting that just works without drama.

You've got Trustpilot reviews going back to 2020 showing consistent quality. You've got technical specifications that aren't just marketing fluff. You've got pricing that makes sense and doesn't suddenly triple during renewal. And you've got a founder who apparently can't help himself from jumping into support tickets personally.

In an industry where most providers blend together into an indistinguishable mess of stock photos and generic promises, ExtraVM feels like someone actually trying to build something that works. Whether that's worth your time and money depends on what you need, but the infrastructure and track record suggest they're doing something right.

The servers are fast. The networks are stable. The support responds. And in 2026, that combination is rarer than it should be.
